<h1>Upload Instruction</h1>

Uploading a game should be fairly straight forward.

1. First take out the SD card in the camera and plug it in the USB connector:

2. Plug the USB connector into your PC.
3. Browse to: <a href="http://upload.camera-pan.com" target="_blank">The Camera-Pan Upload site</a>
4. Enter your "Access Code"
5. Fill in your email and the name of the team you played against.

5a.  Click on "Browse Files" and find the the files you wish to upload. There could be as many as 30 video files for one game.
<strong>Please make sure you only select files beggining with "RecM02".</strong> The camera records to 2 video files, one lower quality and one higher. We want the higher:

6. Click "Upload" and wait for the files to upload. Uploads are resumable so if youre connection breaks, the upload will resume from the last file you started on. <strong>Do not close the page or click submit until all files are uploaded.</strong>
7. When that has done our AI will get to work and you will soon receive an email with the download links.
