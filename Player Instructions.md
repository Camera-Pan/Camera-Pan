<h1>Panorama Player</h1>

This is a video player that can play the 180° video that is downloaded after your game is processed. Currently this only works on Windows. If you require the macOS version then we will generate this on request. 


<h3>Usage</h3>

To use this player, click on the link in the email you receive after your game has been proccessed.
This will download a .zip file with both your video files (The 180° Panorama video and also the "Camera-Panned" video) and also a program named "Panorama_win.exe".

Click on the panorama program and this will launch a web browser for you to view the 180° degree video. In this program you can zoom in and out and also make clips of the game.
