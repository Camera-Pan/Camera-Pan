<h1>Panorama Player</h1>

This is a video player that can play the 180° video that is downloaded after your game is processed. Currently this only works on Windows. If you require the macOS version then we will generate this on request. 


<h3>Usage</h3>

To use this player, click on the link in the email you receive after your game has been proccessed.
This will download a .zip file with both your video files (The 180° Panorama video and also the "Camera-Panned" video) and also a program named "Panorama_win.exe".

Click on the panorama program and this will launch a web browser for you to view the 180° degree video. In this program you can zoom in and out and also make clips of the game.

You can also adjust a few viewpoint parameters using the sliding controls on the top right corner.

Recording
Our player has a built-in recorder that can be used to crop video to create highlights. This feature is similar to the Kern Burns effect in iMovie, but more powerful mostly because you can add more than 2 cropping boxes.
